## Task list items (extension)

GFM enables the `tasklist` extension, where an additional processing step is
performed on [list items].

A [task list item](@) is a [list item][list items] where the first block in it
is a paragraph which begins with a [task list item marker] and at least one
whitespace character before any other content.

A [task list item marker](@) consists of an optional number of spaces, a left
bracket (`[`), either a whitespace character or the letter `x` in either
lowercase or uppercase, and then a right bracket (`]`).

When rendered, the [task list item marker] changes the list item marker, 
replacing the standard disc, circle or 
other marker with unicode characters that represent
an open box or a box with a checkmark.  
It relies on relatively new 
[CSS capability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type)
which allows `list-style-type` to be a `<string>` (and thus, to contain arbitrary unicode symbols)

If the character between the brackets is a whitespace character, the list marker
renders as an empty checkbox: if it is an 'x', the marker renders as a checked checkbox.

```````````````````````````````` example
- [ ] foo
- [x] bar
.
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2610   ';">foo</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2611   ';">bar</li>
</ul>

Task lists can be arbitrarily nested:

```````````````````````````````` example
- [x] foo
  - [ ] bar
  - [x] baz
- [ ] bim
.
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2611   ';">foo
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2610   ';">bar</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2611   ';">baz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '\2610   ';">bim</li>
</ul>
